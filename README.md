Android Studio Problems:
I downloaded the updated version of android studio in my Pc and to build my project. To see the output, I used my android phone because the enumerator is very slow in my machine. My phone is not coming up as connected device when I play my project in android studio. Though, my android phone is connected to my pc but it is not coming in android studio. Than after searching on google I find out that I need to download usb driver, web driver in android studio inside sdk tools option. After installing them, it works and I get output. This tool is new to me so I faced so many problems for instance: adding button, background, designing, preview, colouring, connecting activity, changing android manifest intent etc. Apart from this, I have to reduce the pixel of the picture I used in my background because high resolution picture is giving error in log cast and run.

Coding Problems:
In coding, my data was fetching properly but showing in list view take a lot of time. I got error in it many time for my syntax. Somehow, I figured out all errors from stack overflow and I watched few videos online or udemy to do my list view. For marker in map activity, I created few arrays in adapter to connect to connects java file where list is generated. It is all interlinked so that latitude and longitude get separated and for-loop can use to put marker in map. Moreover, I created array for title as name of the station come on clicking the marker. I attached weather activity to open when marker is clicked on map for Dublin. I created function java file for weather to fetch and parse the data in nice way in my ne intent. Connecting activity is hard first time, but when thing get clear in my mind it was easy for me to connect activity when button is pressed or clicked.

Git Hub problems:
I created my account in GitHub and try to push my project in it. I was getting error in it. I watched some tutorial to fix my error. Then I fixed by going in version control option and tested both git and GitHub. After test was successful for both, I enable the version control. I shared my project on GitHub but data was not going. Then I went to download git.exe drivers from google. After downloading I have to run two command (git config –global user.Email ”my email”) (git config –global user.Name ”my name”) and it works for me. I went to VCS and commit changes and from git option I pushed my whole project successfully on git hub.
